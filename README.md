# optimistic-oracle-v1
A professional implementation of an Optimistic Oracle system for decentralized data feeds. It utilizes a "dispute-and-resolution" mechanism, allowing users to propose data points that are assumed true unless challenged by validators, significantly reducing on-chain gas costs for non-critical data updates.
